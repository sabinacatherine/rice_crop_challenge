> More than 800 million people regularly go to bed hungry.
>
> Climate change is one of the causes of acute hunger. And this is likely to increase as we continue to experience increasing temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, greater frequency of extreme events and rising sea levels. 
>
> At the same time, we are in the midst of a data revolution. There is no shortage of data available but we lack the understanding and interpretation of the data needed to draw actionable conclusions.   
>
> No one solution can solve world hunger. But we can play a role in helping mitigate it.  
>
> Be part of a movement to make science more accessible. Join the open science challenge to help feed the world.

## The challenges:

The EY open data science challenge for 2023 is divided into 2 levels:

1. [Crop Identification](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges/level-1-crop-identification-global)

2. [Crop Forcasting](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges/level-2-crop-forecasting-qEk17wFWyq)

<br>

### Crop Identification

Our first goal is to train a machine learning model to identify what is a rice crop field against what isn't based on satellite images.

The satelite images are taken from Sentinel-1 and are available publicly on [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog?filter=sentinel-1)

The data available for the challenge can be found in the Data/ directory.

### Crop Forcasting

At a later stage, we may want to build a machine learning model that can predict how much rice a rice field will grow. Using [Sentinel-2](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog?filter=sentinel-2) data.
